    "1. **Layout Parser**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses ML models to detect blocks: paragraphs, headings, tables, figures, etc.\n",

    "   * Extracts text, tables, and basic layout data directly from PDF.\n",
    "3. **PyTesseract (if scanned regions exist)**\n",

    "✅ **Combined Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detects block types (paragraph, table, figure)\n",
    "* Extracts tables in structured form\n",
    "* Extracts images with bounding boxes and can crop them\n",
